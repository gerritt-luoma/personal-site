This is a **very** early stage work in progress.  As more work is being done I will update this README over time with progress and how to install/run the project.

## My stack
For fun: Here are some outputs from chatGPT explaining why I chose the different tools in my stack.
### Next.js
I have chosen to use Next.js for the development of my personal websites because it offers a number of powerful features that make it well-suited for building modern, interactive web applications. One of the key benefits of Next.js is that it is built on top of the popular JavaScript library React, which allows me to easily build reusable components and create a smooth, intuitive user experience. Additionally, Next.js uses file-based routing, which means that I can simply create a new file in the application to add a new route, making it easy to manage the structure and organization of my application. Finally, Next.js offers the ability to generate static or server-side rendered pages, giving me the flexibility to choose the approach that best suits the needs of my particular application. Finally, Vercel offers a free tier for hosting my Next.js application that will help with managing environment variables, git integration, building, and my development as a whole. Overall, Next.js is a powerful tool that has proven to be a valuable asset in the development of my personal websites.

### Mantine
I have chosen to use Mantine as my UI library because it offers a number of features that make it well-suited for my needs as a developer. One of the primary reasons I chose Mantine is that it is a highly accessible and user-friendly library that allows me to easily create beautiful, functional interfaces without needing to have advanced skills in HTML and CSS. This has been particularly helpful for me as I am still learning these technologies and want to focus more on the architecture of my website rather than getting bogged down in the details of design. Additionally, Mantine offers a wide range of pre-designed components that I can easily customize and incorporate into my application, saving me time and effort in the development process. Overall, Mantine has proven to be an invaluable resource as I work to build the user interface for my personal website.

### Planetscale
I have chosen to use Planetscale as my database because it offers a number of benefits that make it well-suited for my needs. One of the primary reasons I chose Planetscale is that it is a serverless storage platform that uses MySQL, which is a well-known and widely used database management system. This makes it easy for me to integrate Planetscale into my application using an ORM, as MySQL is a well-supported database that has many available libraries and tools. Additionally, Planetscale offers a free tier that allows me to get started with the platform at no cost, making it a cost-effective choice for my personal website. Overall, Planetscale has proven to be a reliable and convenient choice for my database needs, and I am confident that it will continue to serve me well as I develop and maintain my application.

### Prisma
I have chosen to use Prisma as my ORM to manage my Planetscale database because it offers several advantages that make it an ideal choice for my needs. One of the main reasons I selected Prisma is because it seamlessly integrates with TypeScript, which is a typed superset of JavaScript that helps me write more reliable and maintainable code. This has been particularly useful for me as I am still learning SQL and appreciate the extra support and guidance that Prisma provides. Additionally, Prisma simplifies the process of interacting with the database by offering a straightforward and intuitive interface, which allows me to focus on the larger architecture and logic of my application rather than getting bogged down in the details of SQL. Overall, Prisma has proven to be a valuable tool in managing my Planetscale database, and I am confident that it will continue to be an asset as I develop and maintain my application.
